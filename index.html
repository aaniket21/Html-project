        <p class="sectionsebTag text-small">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

            CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML).
            This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files (.css)..</p>

        <p class="sectionsebTag text-small">JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>

        <p class="sectionsebTag text-small">Python is a high level general-purpose programming language. It uses a multi-paradigm approach, meaning it supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs. It was created by Guido van Rossum as a successor to another language (called ABC) between 1985 and 1990, and is currently used on a large array of domains like web development, desktop applications, data science, DevOps, and automation/productivity.Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. Python's license is administered by the Python Software Foundation.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">C++ Full Lectures</p>
        <p class="sectionsebTag text-small">C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language.A related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the internet. Java is somewhat simpler and easier to learn than C++ and has characteristics that give it other advantages over C++. However, both languages require a considerable amount of study.</p>
